# Sunyata Product Management App

## Overview

This project is a simple product management application built with Vue.js. It allows users to view, create, edit, and delete products. This was a learning project for myself so please forgive any mistakes. It was created as a personal challenge to learn two frameworks in two days so please forgive any minor mistakes. I initially started in Angular, but I was able to move to Vue in a single day. As a result, I'm still learning the ins and outs, so any feedback would be appreciated. ðŸ˜…
